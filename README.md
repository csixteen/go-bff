# go-brainfuck
I don't know Go. So I decided to try and make a port of my [original](https://github.com/csixteen/useless/blob/master/py-brainfuck_v2.py) Python Brainfuck interpreter to Go, just for the fun. I'm pretty sure it can be improved, so I'll probably do it whenever I have time to dedicate to useless projects.
